## Access via Proxy Server

To fetch devices and scenes from your SmartThings hub, you need a **proxy server URL**.

We provide an example proxy server here:  
üëâ https://github.com/PSangEon/smartthigs-proxy

Set up and run this proxy server by following the instructions in the repository.

Once running, copy the base URL of your proxy (for example: `https://your-proxy-server.com`).

Enter this URL into the plugin or client that connects to SmartThings.

‚úÖ The proxy server will handle OAuth tokens securely on your behalf.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**  
Only use proxy servers you trust.  
The proxy has permission to control your devices, so keep the connection and server secure.

## Informations

This project is branched from:  
https://github.com/thibautsabot/typescript-streamdeck-boilerplate/

The reason for this fork is due to recent changes by Samsung SmartThings,  
where **personal access tokens now expire after 24 hours**.  
Because of this, a full **OAuth authentication flow** is required to ensure stable and secure long-term access.

To handle this, we have added a **proxy server example** that manages OAuth on behalf of the client,  
and the plugin is now designed to receive a **proxy server URL** instead of directly handling tokens.

You can find the proxy server here:  
üëâ https://github.com/PSangEon/smartthigs-proxy

‚ö†Ô∏è Please note:  
I have made only **minor code modifications** in this fork.  
Depending on the original repository owner's request, the public availability or details of this fork **may change** in the future.
